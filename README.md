# Extended Euclidean Algorithm Calculator ðŸ§®

## How it was Developed 
I created this Extended Euclidean Algorithm in my first term of university when I studied both this algorithm for linear diophantine equations in math class as well as functional programming using the Racket language in my CS class.

## Usage 
Recommended to run this program on Racket's own IDE: DrRacket.
